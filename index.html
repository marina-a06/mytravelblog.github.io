    <h1>My Travel Blog: Frank Lloyd Wright</h1>
    <h2>Visiting Frank Lloyd Wright Designed Homes</h2>
    <p>This is my personal travel blog to log all my visit to Frank Lloyd Wright locations.  My goal of blogging these visits, 
    is to show you how accessable the history of our Architecture is in the US.</p>

    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>  
<h3>My name is Marina and I was an aspiring Architecture Student back in the early 2000's.  
I firt learn about the American Architect, Frank Lloyd Wright, at this time and became instantly intrigued by his work.  
I cannot tell you exactly what it was, maybe its my connnections to the midwest or just the sheer beauty of Fallingwater, I was inspired!
So, here I am, 37 year old, still searching for his work.</h3>

<h2>Who Is Frank Lloyd Wright?</h2>
<h3>Lloyd Wright was born to Anna Lloyd Jones and William Carey Wright on June 8, 1867 in Richland Center, Wisconsin.  
His mother, Anna, was a teacher, which would later be significant to his legacy in his love for building building blocks and nature, 
and his father was a well-known pastor and musician for the Unitarian community.  
In his infant years, his father travelled with his family along the east coast of the United States with different Unitarian Missionaries 
until they finally moved back to Wisconsin when they fell on hard times financially.  

At 18 years old, Frank's parents would eventually divorce leading him to begin working for the engineering department for the 
University of Wisconsin where he studied in the Engineering department. This would go on to lead him of dreaming to be an architect 
and pursing his life in Chicago, 150 miles away from home.  

Frank Lloyd Wright would go on designing projects and end up being one of the most influential American Architects of the time.  
In the beginning of 1900, Frank designed and built some of the first known categorized Prairie School homes in the Midwest of the United States.  
Following the Great Depression, in 1934, Frank Lloyd Wright began to design homes for the middle class family called Usonian.</h3>

# Frank Lloyd Wright My Travel Blog

## Project Overview

This website is a personal travel blog documenting my visits to various **Frank Lloyd Wright designed homes** across the United States. Inspired by his inovating architecture designs, the site is designed to share photos and experiences from each location in a clean and engaging format.

As part of the Project 03 assignment, this blog aims to serve as a digital journal that blends travel storytelling with architectural appreciation. It is a simple, two-page static website built with HTML and CSS and hosted via GitHub Pages.

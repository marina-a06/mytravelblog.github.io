# Frank Lloyd Wright My Travel Blog

## What went well?  
Organizing the project went smoothly.  It took a basic understanding of what steps needed to be taken in order to move to the next one. The project description was reiterated multiple times leading up to the project and that helped mentally prepare you for the upcoming assignment.

## What went wrong?  
I cloned my repository wrong in the final project. The instructions show a picture that looks different that your screen. Do not guess and "do something different".  Slow down, read between the lines, do not overthink it and you will figure it out without wasting more time stressing on it.

## What would you do differently?  
In the future, I would write more down or save webpages relevent to the new task you are learning.  When you need to complete the task again, it took too much time trying to find previous documents explaining how to do it. Write it down! All the tutorial webpages need to be saved as a reference as well.

# Frank Lloyd Wright My Travel Blog  

## Project Purpose  
Younger generations are unfamiliar with the roots of residential architecture in the United States. My goal is to bring alive the works of Frank Lloyd Wright and show how easily accessable his work and history is to us today.

## Description  
I will document my travels over the past several years where I was able to visit homes designed by Wright. I will showcase how Frank Lloyd Wright has influenced these areas I visited and how accessable they can be.  

## Desired Results  
Frank Lloyd Wright's legacy should live on through the generations to come.  The more exposure to Wright's work will bring to life his legacy he has left behind. 
 
## Exclusions  
Homes I have not personally visited will not be included.  

## Priorities  
1. Quality: The most important part of this project is to ensure the website is visually appealing and covers the topics clearly.  
2. Budget: The cost to travel will have to be in consideration and budgeted accordanlly to travel to places where Frank Lloyd Wright has homes to see.  
3. Time: There is not time contraints on the completion of visiting every home Frank Lloyd Wright has designed.  The visit will be expected to be documented within 1 month of a visit.  

## Acceptance Criteria  
The final website will be signed off by Professor Gamel.
